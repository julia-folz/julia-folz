# Hi, nice to meet you 👋

## Who am I?🪞
I am an enthusiastic researcher with a strong interest in unveiling the mechanisms underlying social behaviour as well as the role of emotions in social encounters. By combining and integrating multiple measures in my studies (e.g., behavior, brain activity, physiology, subjective experience), I aim to capture the beautiful complexity and dynamic nature of social interactions.

## What's my professional background? 👩‍🎓
I'm about to finish up my PhD in Cognitive Psychology at Leiden University. This is my thesis title: 
*Resonating emotions: An embodied perspective on alterations in facial emotion processing in autism and social anxiety*

I've also already started a Postdoc at Research Institute of Child Development and Education, University of Amsterdam. Here, I’m interested in studying the role of mother-infant attunement in the emerging abilities of infants to regulate themselves, including their emotions.

## What's my experience with programming? ⌨
I've mainly used Matlab and R in the past, and would like to learn how to code with Python.

## What else do I enjoy doing in life?
- being active in nature (running, hiking, skiing...) and doing (aerial) yoga 🏞🧘‍♀️
- going to concerts/festival, markets & musea 🎛✨
- baking, crocheting/knitting and reading 🧁🧶
- ...and so much more
